# Temporal Neural Analysis on Motor Cortex
Using recorded motor neuronâ€™s data of a macaque monkey during a reach-to-grasp task, we studied how motor and premotor neural responses are related to events in time. This study shows that activation during hand movements can be acceptable and some movement features are encoded in these neurons. This project is done as a project of the Foundation of Neuroscience course.

This repo contains all the codes implemented, the project description, and the report file.
